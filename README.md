## Description

I created an application called The Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.The applicationâ€™s front end and back is deployd to Heroku.


## Link to Heroku

Visit my [Note Taker](https://woodys-notetaker.herokuapp.com/) and go make your notes!

## Usage

This project can be used to generate a collection of notes which you remove when you no longer need them. Simple styling and basic format make it easy to use.
